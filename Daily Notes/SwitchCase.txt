Switch Case:


Switch case is replace of multiple "else if" statements.

Switch case will work on cases that were mentioned by the user.

only when the matching case is available, switch case will execute only that particular matching case alone.


it will not check any other cases.

What will happen if any one of the case is not getting matched?

on the switch case, there will be a case called "default".
if the user has given this default block, tehn this block will executed whene ever there is an invalid entry


syntax:

switch(key)
{

case somevalue:

	//logic
	break;

case somevalue:

	//logic
	break;
default:
	//logic


}


Note:
If we observe in the above synatx, there is a break statement avilable

it is mandatory , to give a break statement after every logic in the block

if we are not giving the break statement after the business logic, the compiler will execute the next block(case)

After the break statement we are not suppose to write any other statements, except a case.
