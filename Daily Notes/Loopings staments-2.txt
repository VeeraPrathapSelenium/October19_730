Break :


Break is a keyword which is used to exit from the loop
We need to use the break statement based on some condition


Continue:

Continue is a keyword which is used to skip the current iteration.


While:

This loop is called as indefinite or infinite loop

This loop will not  have self increment factor as how we have in for loop

User must needs to provide the increment factor.


How while loop will work?

it will check for the true condition, if satatement is true then itr allows to execute the body



Do while?
intially for the first time it will not check for the  condition, without checking any condition the body will get executed.

once the body is executed, it will check for the condition

on second iteration onwards, it will check for the condition is true or false.

only the condition is true, the body will get executed.


from this loop. we underatnd that, atleast once my logic will get executed.
