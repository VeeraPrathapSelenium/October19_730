I dentified an element using xpath  but selenium web driver is failing to click on it.

Then i changed the selector to css, even though i changed it is failing to click on it how can i handle this situation?

In such cases, using javascript exceutor in oder to click onthe element.

This javascript executor is called as an interface

using this java script executor , we can able to click the buttons even if they are in hidden mode

User can execute the function which are available in the background in js format


Syntax:

JavaScriptExecutor js=(JavaScriptExecutor) driverObject;
js.executeScript("arguments[0].click();",WebElement);
