Collection frame work in java


Collection is a root interface

Under this we have 

	* List
	* Set
	* Queue

Typically a variable is used to store a single value,

To over the above problem arrays were introduced.

But in arrays, the size is fixed and it can be change in run time.

To over come this colelction frame work is introduced.

There is a huge difference between collection and collections

Collection is an interface
Collections is an utility class having different methods associated with it.

In General an interface will not allow the user to create an object to the interface, where as a class allows the user to create an object


So in according to it, under collection interface we have 3 main sub interface which are called as 

	* List
	* Set
	* Queue
Each one of this is used to store the objects

So collection is called as collection of objects

When the user doesnt specify any time, each one of the collection object has tendency to store different types

But also collection support generic types



List:

List is an interface, where not allowed to create an object

The list is implemented in Arraylist,linked list and vector stack


syntax:

List somerefvariable=new ArrayList();

Withtype:

List<String> somerefvar=new ArrayList<String> ();


List allows the user to add multiple items
List allows the user to add duplicate values
List preserve the order of insertion
List allows the user to iterate over a iterator called list iterator

List allows the user to add a null 

Note:
To retrive an item from a list , one must specify an index.
