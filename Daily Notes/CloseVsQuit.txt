How can i close a browser?

driverobject.close();

How can i kill a current session?


driverobject.quit();


difference between close and quit?
close====it will only close the browser, but the driver object will be always be in live state, user can open a new browser with the existing driver object.


quit===it will kill the driver object, user can not use the existing driver object to open a new browser, instead he need to redeclare the drivcer object.


When should i use close and quit?


after each test case use close, after each suite use quit
