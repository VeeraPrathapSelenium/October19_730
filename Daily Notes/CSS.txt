What is meant CSS?

CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

Thesewere used by the devlopers to give rich look ui on the front end.


As we all know that, using xpath we cAN IDENTIFY AN ELEMENT, TO THIS SIMILAR, css ALSO FIT FOR identifying the elements on the DOM.

But the only thing i need to remember here is , Xpath have more oprtion to identify an element, where as CSS have less option to identify an element.

Note:

When we start writting the css, just check if there is an id available.


Then user can use "#id"

Identify the element using class:

synatx:.classname

Handling dynamic properties of an attribute using CSS:

Normal Syntax:
htmltag[attribute='value']

starts-with==^
htmltag[attribute^='value']


contains==*
htmltag[attribute*='value']


ends-with==$
htmltag[attribute$='value']

Note:In CSS we can not use text as how we use in Xpath

How to traverse from a element as how we traverse in xpath?

Yes we can traverse using ">"

When i dentify an element with css, i am getting mutiple values for suppose in the below example

<select name="DateOfBirthDay">
	<option value="0">Day</option>
	<option value="1">1</option>
	<option value="2">2</option>
	<option value="3">3</option>
	<option value="4">4</option>
	<option value="5">5</option>
	<option value="6">6</option>
	<option value="7">7</option>
	<option value="8">8</option>
	<option value="9">9</option>
	<option value="10">10</option>
</select>

CSS:select[name$='DateOfBirthDay']>option

here i am getting mutiple option values,

From this can i able to select a specific element?

Using "nth-child(index)"


Can i find siblings(Following-sibling) using css
Yes by using "+"

Using this syntax, we will get the next immidiate sibling only, in other words , we will get only one element
