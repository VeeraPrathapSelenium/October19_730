Object oriented programming.

it helps the user to develop the applications based on a relationship as how the real world exist.

There few major components available in the OOPS

	* Class
	* Object
	* Inheritance
	* Polymorphisim
	* Encapsulation

	* Interfaces

Class is called as a blueprint, where user will define the logic inside it.

Object is an instance of class, which allows to access the properties of the class for which object is created.

It is one of the major pillar of the OOPS concept.
it is used to estlablish the relation between two class using a keyword called "extends"


it is simply defined as "Acquiring the properties of a parent class by a child class"
