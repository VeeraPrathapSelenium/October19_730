Looping statements:

Java supports the following looping statements

	* for
	* while
	* do while
	* for each

Why looping statements are required?

To repeat a same statement for a specific number of times, this looping statements are used.


Looping statements are also to iterate the value of a variable in run time


Understand how the for loop will get executed:

Syntax:

for(int somevariable;condition;increment/decrement)
{

//logic

}

This for loop is called as "definite loop"

Problem statements 1:

As an user i want to print "Welcome" for 20 times 



Problem statement 2:

Print 5 table using for loop


5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 =15
5 * 4 = 20


5 * 20 =100

user_given_input +"*" +i = user_given_input * i




Problem statemts:

Print first 50 even numbers

Print first 50 odd numbers

print first 50 prime numbers

write a logic of factorial program

write a logtic of armstrong number
