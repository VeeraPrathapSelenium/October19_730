i want to develop a app for school registration.

the feature of school app must have 

	* adding a student
	* deleting a student
	* searching a student
	
Conditions:

As user i must be able to send the details of the student like name, class, section

your logic must generate a sequential id for each student


Your app must be able to customize, when i sold this app to any other school

Use proper oops concepts and implement this.



Sending datat to class is achived only by using the constructor

This constructor is used to intilize the classlevel variables

this constructor will invoke when ever a object to that particular class is created

constructor is available in two formats
	* parametrized constructor
	* non-parameterized constructor

By default , when the user not created any constructor, a zero argument based constructor will be created in the back ground


A constructor will always be like a classname
it is also a block , which contains the busness logic, and will get executed onlu on the object creation.
