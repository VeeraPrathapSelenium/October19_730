Strings:

Strings are called as collection of words, numbers,special characters including white space.

Strings must be represented in "Double Quotes"

What ever we represent inside the double quotes, we treat it as string.

String can be declared in multiple ways:

	1. String somevariable="india 1234 /*-- ";
	2. String somevariable=new String("india 1234 /*-- ");
	3. StringBuffer somevariable=new StringBuffer("Some data)
	4. StringBuilder someref=new StringBuilder("some data");



Based on type of declartion string will get memory shared on two regions

	* Heap memory
	* String constant pool memeory or pool memory


With this concept we call strings as "immutable"
