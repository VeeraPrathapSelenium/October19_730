Arrays:

Arrays are called as collection of same datatype items
Once you declare an array of some type, we can cant add any other data type item

So with reason arrays are called as "HOMOGENIUS"

Note:

Once declared an array with some size, one can not change the size in run time.

So arrays length is called as Fixed Length

Arrays elements can be "Duplicate"


When you add an item into an array, the item will be inserted at the respective index.

index will always start from "ZERO"

so it means that, when ever the user want to retrive the data from the array, one must retrive it on index only.


Can i able to update an item on the array?

Yes, we can but we must need to specify the index, where we want to change the item.


How to create an array?

DataType[] somename=new DataType[size];

DataType[] somename={"item1","item2"......."item3"};



How can i add an other datatype items into an array?

Yes we can add by using hetrogenius array called "Object Array"

Syntax:  
Object[] somevariablename=new Object[size]
