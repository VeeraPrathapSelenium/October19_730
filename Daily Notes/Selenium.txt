HTML Tags are classified into two categories:



	* Paired HTML Tags
	* Unpaired HTML Tags


Tags which are having opeening and closing is called as "Paired Tag"

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>

</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

</BODY>
</HTML>
Begin your main body of text here.




Tags which are not having closing tags are called as Unpaired tags

ex:
<img>,<input>



For these unpair tags , we wil not have innertext or innerHTML



To identify any one these elements we need some identification properties we called it as locator or selectors etc


there 8 types of selectors where selenium supports to identify an element on the browser


	* ID
	* Name
	* CSS====******
	* XPATH===*****
	* Link Text
	* Partial Link Text
	* Tag name
	* Classname

The above listed attributes will be given by the actual developer of the application.



these properties might be dynamic or static in nature, but QA must need to handle the dynamic properties accordinglyl.
