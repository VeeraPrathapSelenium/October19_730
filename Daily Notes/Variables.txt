How to start writing java program?

As an developer i must adhere to teh rules of java

1.User can build his/her business logics only in class file

2.Understand what is the structure of a class

Remember that that class is having a proper defined syntax

Synatx:

class ClassName
{
	//Business Logic
}

3.How to start writingmy business logics?
Understand that class is ahving 5 major components

	* Variables
	* Methods
	* static block
	* instance block
	* constructor

Note:
The major rule that i need to remember is 

Where ever i wrote my logics, but to make my logics to be get executed, it must be call or access within the main block.

main block is called as mainmethod.


syntax:

class ClassName{

public static void main(String[] args){
//call or access your business logic here

}

}

In Java if we need to print or display and output
we use a statement called 

system.out.println("Statement here");

When ever your statement is completed it must be end with "semicolon"


Lets understand, the first major component of a class



Variable:

Variable is called as memory holder to save the data and to send the data

to store data into a variable, we must need to define its type.

defining type is called as "DataType"

Datatype is the one which tells that what kind of data that the user is going store in the memory

syntax of creating a variable:

datatype variableName;

The above statement is called as "Declaration"

when we declared a variable, compiler will create a memory space to store the data


Now we need to insert a value inside the memory block


inserting value into a memory block is called as "intilization"

syantx:

variable=some value;


Together Syntax:

Datatype variablename;
variablename=somevalue;

This datatype is classified into 2 types

	* Primitive Datatype
	* Non-Primitive Datatypes

What is the difference in between these two?

1.Abbrevated cases

Total 8 types whaich are common between these two

Non Primitive:
===================
int
boolean
char
short
double
long
float
byte


Primitive:
===================
Integer
Boolean
Character
Short
Double
Long
Float
Byte

Strings
BIGDECIMAL
ARRAYS....

For all primitive datatypes there aree some metrhods associated with it.


for non primitive we dont have any methods mappede
