Writing XPATH:

xpath is available in two forms

	* Absolute XPATH
	* Relative XPATH

Absolute xpath will denote with "/"

Relative xpath will denote with "//"


Absolute xpath will take reference from the root element called "HTML"


Relative xpath will take reference from the intermidiate element level

What exactly a xpath mean?

It helps the user to identify the element of an application through DOM

DOM stands for "DOcument Object Model"

Taking absolute xpath into considersation is completely a wrong step.

As it takes reference from the Root element HTML, it consumes much time in identifying an element.

So to replace this, we use Relative xpath in place.


How to write a relative xpath?

//htmltag[@attribute='value']

This will work only if the attributes are getting match

attribute might be 
	* id
	* class
	* name
etc.
There will some custom attributes which are defined by the developer of the application.

These attributes may be static or might be dynamic in nature.

While we write any xpath , check if you are having an "id"

Id is a unique representaion of an element, only single occurance will be there.


How can i say if that ID is static or not?

It is difficult to identify if the id is static or not, but at the high level we can examinbe the id.

When your id is binded with a numeric we can expect that id will be change every time


Fine..!! when there is a direct attribute we do not face any issue, in case there attributes are purely dynamic in nature
or if there is no attributes available, then we need to handle effectively

To do this we must need to understand , the types that are avilable under relative xpath.

	* Farward xpath

		following-sibling:: * or htmltag
		child:: * or htmltag
		following::* or htmltag
		descendants::* or htmltags


	* Backward xpath

		preceding-sibling:: * or htmltag
		parent:: htmltag
		preceding::* or htmltag
		ansector::* or htmltags

	* logical xpath

		and , or

	* Function notated xapth
			text()---works only on pair tags
			starts-with()
			contains()
			last()
			normalize-space()
			()--group

How to use text() method:

this method can implement directly on any paired html tag

this method will check all the html tags whose text is matching with user given string

we may get one or multiple elements


these elements which are identified more than one might be visible or hidden in the backgroud

we must need to see which of those element is getting highleighted in the FE.


When we try to identify the text of an element, we may get a space before or after.

One must need to ignore the spaces on the text, with help of a method called normalize-space().

normalize-space() is method which can be implemented only on text method


*****
When we we have multiple elements on the identification process, if we want to identify specific elements, tehn use group---(), later specify the index position



Syantx to use text() method with normalize-space():

//htmltag[normalize-space(text())='value']

Syantx to use text() method with ():
(//htmltag[normalize-space(text())='value'])[index value]
