Configure Maven


Maven is a build tool, which is used to download the depency jar files that are required on our project.

Every time user is not required to download and patch the jarafile.


in maven we have a file called "POM.xml"


POM stands fro project object model.


This XML contains majorly 2 section


	<Depencies>
	<build>

<Dependencies>:

in this section we will provide the required depencies on our project

<Build>
in this section we provide the classfile or unit test xml file where our test cases need to get execute.

This maven project is having a conditional check before proceeding to download.


The check will be on the Local Repsoitory Vs Remote Repositry


When we download the maven, by default under c:\User there will be a folder called .m2

Under this there will be a folder called "repository"

this folder is called as "Local Repository"


So maven before downloading any files from the remote repository(cloud), it will check in the local first, if not available it will fetch from remote repository




Steps to configure the maven project:

1.Go to google and search for maven
